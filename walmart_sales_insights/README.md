# Walmart Sales Data Analysis

### Description:
This project analyzes Walmart sales data to extract actionable business insights. By leveraging pandas for data cleaning and transformation, along with pandasql for advanced querying, I address key business questions using structured problem-solving techniques. I use the matplotlib library to visualize trends and patterns, providing valuable insights that can inform decision-making and strategy.
