## Overview

This is a data analysis and machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. The project uses SQL for data cleaning and preprocessing, Power Query and DAX in Power BI for data transformation and visualization, and machine learning algorithms for churn prediction. The final result is an interactive dashboard that provides insights into customer churn and predictions.

## Tools Used:
PostgreSQL, Power BI, Python (for machine learning)

## Project Flow

### 1. **SQL Data Preprocessing**

#### Table Creation & Data Import:
The project starts by creating a `customer_data` table to store customer attributes, such as service usage, billing information, and churn status. Data is imported from a CSV file into the database using the `COPY` command.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Several SQL queries are used to explore the data:
- **Distinct Values:** The distribution of attributes like Gender, Contract, State, and Customer_Status is checked.
- **Null Value Identification:** A query counts the number of null values in each column, identifying missing or incomplete data.
- **Revenue Analysis:** The total revenue is calculated for different customer statuses.

#### Data Cleansing:
A new table, `prod_Churn`, is created to handle missing values by replacing them with default values like 'None' or 'No'.

### 2. **Power BI Data Transformations (Power Query)**

#### Churn Status Transformation:
- **Churn Status:** A new column is added to the `prod_Churn` table to create a binary value for churn status (1 for "Churned", 0 for "Stayed").
- **Change Data Type:** The data type for Churn Status is changed to a number for further analysis.

#### Monthly Charge Range Transformation:
- **Monthly Charge Range:** A new column is created to categorize `monthly_charge_range` into ranges: "< 20", "20-50", "50-100", and "> 100".

#### Age Group Mapping (Mapping_AgeGrp):
- A new table is created for age groups based on the `age` column, categorized into groups: "< 20", "20-35", "36-50", and "> 50".
- The `AgeGrpSorting` column is created to assign a numeric value to each group for sorting purposes.

#### Tenure Group Mapping (Mapping_TenureGrp):
- A new table is created for tenure groups based on `tenure_in_months`, categorized into ranges: "< 6 Months", "6-12 Months", "12-18 Months", "18-24 Months", and ">= 24 Months".
- The `TenureGrpSorting` column is created for sorting these groups numerically.

### 3. **Power BI Dashboard Creation**

#### Churn Trends & Insights Dashboard:

An interactive Power BI dashboard is created to visualize customer churn insights, focusing on identifying patterns and factors affecting customer retention. The dashboard includes the following visualizations:

- **Total Customers**: Count of all customers in the dataset.
- **New Joiners**: Count of customers who joined the service.
- **Total Churn**: Count of churned customers (based on the Churn Status column).
- **Churn Rate**: The percentage of churned customers relative to the total customer base.

### 4. **Machine Learning for Churn Prediction**

#### Model Building:
Machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) is applied to predict churn using the cleaned data from the `prod_Churn` table.
- Features like `monthly_charge`, `tenure_in_months`, and `age` are used to train the model.

#### Model Evaluation:
The model is evaluated using common metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score and support to ensure the effectiveness of the churn prediction model.
