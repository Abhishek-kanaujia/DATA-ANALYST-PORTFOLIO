# Credit Card Customer-Transaction Report

## Purpose
This project aims to analyze customer transaction data for a credit card company to uncover meaningful insights and trends. The goal is to help the company make data-driven decisions to improve customer experience, optimize operations, and increase revenue.

## Project Objectives
- Understand customer spending patterns.
- Identify high-value customers and their transaction behavior.
- Analyze transaction trends across different demographics.
- Provide actionable recommendations to enhance business strategy.

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Power BI**: Used to design interactive dashboards and analyze data.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Utilized for initial data preparation and cleaning.

## Steps
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Conducted data cleaning in Excel to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent formatting.
2. **Data Modeling**: Designed data models and relationships in Power BI for efficient analysis.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Built interactive and user-friendly dashboards to visualize key metrics and trends.
4. **Analysis**: Performed in-depth analysis on customer transactions, demographics, and spending behavior.

## DAX Queries

The following DAX queries were used to enhance the analysis and segmentation in the project:

### **Age Group Classification**
To categorize customers based on their age, the following DAX formula was used:

```DAX
AgeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 30 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40, "30-40",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 40 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50, "40-50",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60",
    'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60, "60+",
    "unknown"
)
```
This formula classifies customers into distinct age groups to better understand customer behavior across different age ranges.

### **Income Group Classification**
To categorize customers into income groups:

```DAX
IncomeGroup = SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    'public cust_detail'[income] < 35000, "Low",
    'public cust_detail'[income] >= 35000 && 'public cust_detail'[income] < 70000, "Med",
    'public cust_detail'[income] >= 70000, "High",
    "unknown"
)
```
This helps in understanding customer behavior and targeting high, medium, and low-income segments for marketing strategies.

### **Week Number for Transactions**
To calculate the week number of each transaction:

```DAX
week_num2 = WEEKNUM('public cc_detail'[week_start_date])
```

### **Revenue Calculation**
The revenue from each transaction is calculated by adding annual fees, transaction amounts, and interest earned:

```DAX
Revenue = 'public cc_detail'[annual_fees] + 'public cc_detail'[total_trans_amt] + 'public cc_detail'[interest_earned]
```

### **Current Week Revenue**
To calculate revenue for the current week:

```DAX
Current_week_Revenue = CALCULATE(
    SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('public cc_detail'),
        'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])
    )
)
```

### **Previous Week Revenue**
To calculate revenue from the previous week:

```DAX
Previous_week_Revenue = CALCULATE(
    SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
    FILTER(
        ALL('public cc_detail'),
        'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2]) - 1
    )
)
```

These DAX calculations helped in tracking the weekly revenue trends and comparing the current week to the previous week for better forecasting and business insights.

   - **Recommendation**: Tailor marketing efforts and promotions to the high-performing states (TX, NY, CA) to capitalize on existing market strengths. At the same time, consider localized campaigns in these states to maintain momentum and further boost sales.

4. **Improve Activation Rate**  
   - **Insight**: The overall activation rate is 57.5%, indicating that a significant number of customers have not fully engaged with their credit cards.
   - **Recommendation**: Implement targeted outreach programs to increase card activation. Consider offering incentives, such as cashback or bonus points, for customers who activate their cards within a specific time frame.

5. **Reduce Delinquent Rate**
