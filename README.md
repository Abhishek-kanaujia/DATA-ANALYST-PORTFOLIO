# Abhishek Kanaujia - Data Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hello, I'm Abhishek! I hold a B.Tech degree in Mechanical Engineering and have specialized in Data Analysis, SQL, Python, and Power BI. Currently, I’m working as a Software Engineer at Careernet Technologies, where I automate and optimize data processes for clients like Google and IBM India.

Throughout my career, I have gained experience working with large datasets, performing data cleaning, transformation, and building actionable insights. My analytical background allows me to extract valuable information and make data-driven decisions. I’m always eager to learn new tools and techniques to enhance my skills in data science and analytics.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies like AI tools, including ChatGPT, and am passionate about applying automation to improve workflows and reporting.

This repository serves as a showcase of my skills and portfolio projects, where I highlight the work I’ve done in Data Analytics and Data Science.
